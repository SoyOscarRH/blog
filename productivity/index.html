      <h1>Productivity.</h1>
      <section>
        <div class="number">1.</div>
        <div>
          <strong>What is the task we are doing?</strong>
          Make sure you are focused on only one thing at a time.
        </div>

        <div class="number">2.</div>
        <div>
          <strong>You don't feel like starting? </strong>
          Surprise! It is always like this; motion creates emotion.
        </div>

        <div class="number">3.</div>
        <div>
          <strong>Do you have distractions under control? </strong>
          Close the door; close facebook, youtube, and twitter; put your phone
          on do not disturb; put paper or something equivalent to your side in
          case you have an idea.
        </div>

        <div class="number">4.</div>
        <div>
          <strong> Do you want music? </strong>
          Maybe the best thing is to put white noise, listen to a forest on a
          rainy day, classical music, or that soundtrack you love so much.
        </div>

        <div class="number">5.</div>
        <div>
          <strong> Wait... why are we doing this? </strong>
          Do those tasks that motivate you, never forget the reasons why you do
          it, remember all the benefits.
        </div>

        <div class="number">6.</div>
        <div>
          <strong> What are the parts of this task? </strong>
          Split it into little chunks that are concise ; quantize your work.
        </div>

        <div class="number">7.</div>
        <div>
          <strong> Are you bored? </strong>
          Find the way of injecting passion to this task, make it like a game,
          make it excited.
        </div>

        <div class="number">8.</div>
        <div>
          <strong>
            How are you going to reward yourself when you finish?
          </strong>
          A smile, shouting victory, that feeling of understanding a little bit
          more about the world, or a quick 15 minutes break; everything counts.
        </div>
        <div class="number">9.</div>
        <div>
          <strong>
            What is a reasonable goal to accomplish in this session?
          </strong>
          Put your head on the ground and be realistic with your expectations.
        </div>
        <div class="number">10.</div>
        <div>
          <strong>
            How long are you going to work until taking a real break?
          </strong>
          Place a maximum time, a specific goal and stick to it, you deserve it.
